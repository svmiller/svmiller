My name is Steven V. Miller and I'm an associate professor of political science currently in the [Department of Political Science](http://www.clemson.edu/cbbs/departments/political-science/) at [Clemson University](http://www.clemson.edu/). I'm also a [BITSS Catalyst](https://www.bitss.org/people/steven-miller/) with the [Berkeley Initiative for Transparency in the Social Sciences](https://www.bitss.org/). My research and teaching interests focus on the broad intersection of international conflict and political behavior. 

My Github interests are varied, but I use Github for the following stuff you may find useful:

- **R Markdown/Jekyll templates**: By far the most traffic I get to my Github concerns [my suite of R Markdown templates](https://github.com/svmiller/svm-r-markdown-templates), [my main Jekyll template](https://github.com/svmiller/steve-ngvb-jekyll-template), or [the Jekyll template I use for my course websites](https://github.com/svmiller/course-website).
- **Research**: I've used Github as repos for all my publications since about 2015. Examples include [my 2011 *CMPS*](https://github.com/svmiller/millergibler2011dtnc), [my 2017 *Political Behavior*](https://github.com/svmiller/etst), [my 2017 *PRQ*](https://github.com/svmiller/etjc), [my 2018 *PEPSPP*](https://github.com/svmiller/territorial-threats-corruption-attitudes),  [my 2019 *SSQ*](https://github.com/svmiller/gss-guns-manuscript), [my 2020 *JREP* with Nick Davis](https://github.com/svmiller/woi), and [my 2020 *SSJ*](https://github.com/svmiller/earr).
- **Teaching**: [Introduction to International Relations](https://github.com/svmiller/posc1020), [Quantitative Methods in Political Science](https://github.com/svmiller/posc3410), [International Conflict](https://github.com/svmiller/posc3610), [Foundations of Social Science Research for Public Policy](https://github.com/svmiller/post8000)
