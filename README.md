My name is Steven V. Miller and I'm an associate professor of political science currently in the [Department of Political Science](http://www.clemson.edu/cbbs/departments/political-science/) at [Clemson University](http://www.clemson.edu/). I'm also a [BITSS Catalyst](https://www.bitss.org/people/steven-miller/) with the [Berkeley Initiative for Transparency in the Social Sciences](https://www.bitss.org/). My research and teaching interests focus on the broad intersection of international conflict and political behavior.
