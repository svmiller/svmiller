My name is Steven V. Miller and I'm a docent in the [Department of Economic History and International Relations](https://ekohist.su.se/english/) at [Stockholm University](http://www.su.se). I'm also a [BITSS Catalyst](https://www.bitss.org/people/steven-miller/) with the [Berkeley Initiative for Transparency in the Social Sciences](https://www.bitss.org/). My research and teaching interests focus on the broad intersection of international conflict and political behavior. 

My Github interests are varied, but I use Github for the following stuff you may find useful:

**R Markdown/Jekyll templates**: By far the most traffic I get to my Github concerns [my suite of R Markdown templates](https://github.com/svmiller/svm-r-markdown-templates), [my main Jekyll template](https://github.com/svmiller/steve-ngvb-jekyll-template), or [the Jekyll template I use for my course websites](https://github.com/svmiller/course-website).


**R Packages**: I have several R packages that may interest you.

<!-- [`stevemisc`](https://github.com/svmiller/stevemisc) has some various helper functions I use in my research and teaching. [`stevetemplates`](https://github.com/svmiller/stevetemplates) is an R package for my R Markdown templates. I'll be shifting more time and energy from the "raw" template directory to this R package going forward. [`stevedata`](https://github.com/svmiller/stevedata), which is in development, will host all my toy data sets going forward. I also have an R package for my graduate-level methods course ([`post8000r`](https://github.com/svmiller/post8000r)), but I'll be gradually moving the contents of that (all data) into `stevedata`. Finally, I have an R package ([`dragracer`](https://github.com/svmiller/dragracer)) of data pertaining to the hit American TV show RuPaul's Drag Race. -->
